AIRO course of Fundamentals for Computer Graphics:

Three homeworks (Raytracing, to do, to do) and final project (to do).

Tools we used: C++, Visual Studio Code, CMake, gcc and ninja.

# Raytracing
First part: implementing images with own colors, textures... as we can see here:

Second part: implementation of raytracing shader, with refraction for non-thin materials.

Third part: implementing previous images with a cartoon shader.
